# Codes and programs
A repository of (hopefully) useful codes and programming lectures that I developed organically during my academic career.


### BASH course for researchers
A beginner's bash course for researchers. Targeted to teach how to harness the power of interconnected computer infrastructure.

1. [**BASH basics**](1-bash_basics.md)
2. in progress...
3. [**BASH setup**](3-bash_setup.md)
4. [**Connectivity and remote access**](4-accessing_computers.md)


### Connectivity codes
A set of codes I developed to ease the accessibility and communication in between computers. They can all be seen [on my github, in the "Utilities" section](https://github.com/nlscelli/Utilities).

The main purpose is to be able to execute command remotely, often over an ssh tunnel to jump a proxy. While each code serves a different purpose, in [this page](connectivity_example.md) I break down one of the codes to explain the core components of this kind of BASH programming.
