### about me: Nicolas Luca Celli 

#### Academic interests
I am a seismologist, specialised in imaging the earth's interior using seismic data. During my PhD I focussed on imaging the earth's mantle on a global and continental scale using Big Data and waveform tomography. More recently, I got interested in by using Discrete Particle modelling to simulate the effects of material nonlinearity on seismic waves. 

In my current work within the [DEEP project](http://deepgeothermal.org/home/), I am using Discrete Particle Modelling to simulate and understand the output of cutting-edge sensor technology, in which fiber optic cables are used to record seismic signal (Distributed Acoustic Sensing - **DAS**).

#### Programming
at present day, being a researcher very often requires advanced programming abilities. Experience taught me the importance of writing codes that are not only functional, but also flexible and ready to be used by others (including a forgetful future self). For this reason, I go to great lengths to write well-documented, stable codes, many of which have been successfully used by other users in my research groups.

#### Graphics
I firmly believe that clear graphical representations of data and results are extremely important, especially with the growing availability of increasingly large datasets. A few images can convey information to an audience in a way that is as clear—and at times clearer—than many lines of text, especially when addressing a wider audience. Also, and perhaps more importantly, exploring new ways to look at data can often spark new understanding of them. I like to spend time exploring and finding graphical representations that are both clearly conveying the information, and eye-catching, balancing form and content.
