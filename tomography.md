# Tomographic models

During my PhD, I computed and pubslished several tomographic models of the upper mantle and transition zone. They can be all downloaded from [my website](https://nlscelli.wixsite.com/ncseismology/models).

Models focus on the structure of the [South Atlantic (GJI)](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/221/1/178/5697204?login=true), [Africa (Nature Communications)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13871-2) and the [North Atlantic (EPSL)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X21003034).
