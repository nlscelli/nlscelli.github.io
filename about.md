### about me: Nicolas Luca Celli
I am a seismologist, specialised in imaging the earth's interior using seismic data. During my PhD I focussed on imaging the earth's mantle on a global and continental scale using Big Data and waveform tomography. More recently, I got interested in by using Discrete Particle modelling to simulate the effects of material nonlinearity on seismic waves. 

In my current work within the [DEEP project](http://deepgeothermal.org/home/), I am using Discrete Particle Modelling to simulate and understand the output of cutting-edge sensor technology, in which fiber optic cables are used to record seismic signal (Distributed Acoustic Sensing - **DAS**).
